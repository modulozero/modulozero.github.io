# Gender Shrapnel's Rope Ad

As of 28/11/2023, I'm focused on developing the partnerships I have for a while.
Feel free to hit me up, of course, but depending on my "overwhelmed" level I
might not answer. I'd also prefer to meet at rope jams first, and there's a bit
of a shortage of those - this means it might take _a while_ between us agreeing
to tie and _actually tying_. No, I'm not that popular (thank the gods!), it just
doesn't take a lot to saturate the limited amount of events I attend ;-)

Hey folks,

I'm a "mostly rigging" rope switch with about a year of experience, looking for
a person or two to practice with. Quick things first:

- be over 30, please.
- I'm a sadist, but we probably won't do (much) of this part.
- I'm more interested in the experience of tying and being tied than polished,
  "studio" photos. In fact I generally forget to take photos.
- I generally get along better with people who:
  - think of themselves as leftists.
  - can be described as queer women/non-binary/[WLINTA](https://fetlife.com/users/17008417/posts/9575156).
  - but this is not a play ad, so I _may_ make exceptions. I have tied people
    presenting masculine - but so far not men.
- Body shape and size, superficial presentation, plumbing and fur are irrelevant
  to me. If anything I wouldn't complain about more variety.
- I can host.
- I do like rope jams, but there's a dearth of queer rope jams in my range, so
  even now I rarely have a free partner spot.
- I am primarily looking to practice more. It will hopefully be fun, but any
  play has to be negotiated separately.
- I'd be quite happy to switch, but my experience with _being tied_ is sadly limited.
- But I'm not interested in finding a person who'd do all the tying all the time.

How I tie:

- Usually staying quite close to the model, fairly intense on contact.
- In play I'm a sadist and use rope to hurt or set up for hurt - but this will
  be practice.
- I'm very interested in what the model wants to get out of it. One of my
  "non-technical" practice goals is to get better at reading the people I
  practice with.
- I prefer a relatively small set of partners I know well over quantity.
- My big rope inspirations are currently Hua Hua, Ceci Ferox and Murasaki Haruan.

What can I do for you:

- Tea and or/coffee.
- I'll tie you up, and might do some **partial** suspensions.
- I have a suspension point (an A-frame from X-Pole) but it has its limits, and
  I don’t have enough experience to suspend, or even keep you long in a partial
  suspension.
- Meet up and host about up to once per week.
- Pop up at your place, as long as you’re not too far from Haarlem. Let’s say
  half an hour by train.
- Provide some fancy autistic infodumps.
- Once I'm done with you, and pending extra chats, I might let you practice on me.

What I won't do, within the context of this ad at least:

- A dynamic or sex - it's just not what I'm looking for here.
- Actively sadistic play.
  I might tease a bit, but anything intense rapidly becomes very intimate to me.
- Pay for private classes - I’d love to, actually, but I’m very, very broke
  right now. This part might change in a few months. I hope it will.

Now, a bit more about me:

- I'm a fairly big, middle-aged, [AuDHD](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/AuDHD)
  and lesbian Polish trans woman.
- Generally neurospicy.
- Quite a bit of a communist.
- I'm a dominant switch,
  [stone femme](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Stone%20Femme)
  and a toppy verse.
- Living in a small apartment the center of Haarlem.
- Often tired.
- About a year of experience tying myself and others.
- Minimal experience being tied by others.
- Self taught, but also rope jams and the more “financially accessible”
  workshops, offline and online.
- I consider myself a beginner.
- You can usually meet me and chat with me at Queertied, Rope’Em or Hua Hua’s
  workshops. I’m usually paired already, though, but feel free to ask as long as
  I’m not busy tying someone (tying myself or watching a person I tied counts as
  tying).

So, you got to the end of this. Thank you! If you like this, DM me. If the vibe
seems right, we will:

1. Meet once on neutral ground - there are some nice cafes nearby.

   To find out if we’re gonna stand each other’s presence for two hours or more,
   but also to discuss initial boundaries and expectations.
2. If the vibes still match, we're gonna find a rope jam to tie along for the
   first time.

   I personally think this is just the smart thing to do, and something I'd
   advise everyone to do.
3. If the vibes still match, we’re gonna schedule an afternoon for our first practice.
4. I’ll want to do a debrief afterwards, to find out if we had the correct
   mutual understanding of the aforementioned boundaries and expectations, and
   just how the entire thing worked out, both physically and emotionally.
5. If the vibes still match, rinse and repeat from point 3. Or 2, if there's a
   jam we both like.

That’s it from me. Feel free to check out my profile and ask me any questions
you may have.

Cheers!
