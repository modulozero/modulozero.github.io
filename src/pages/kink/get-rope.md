# Rope Buying Advice for The Rope Salon

This is written specifrically for the December 2024 [Transfem Rope Salon].

Also, I'm not some super experienced rope teacher. I've been tying for 2-3
years, and never got any "formal" (whatever that would mean in ropes) training.
I know a bit, I know what I'm comfortable sharing - but don't assume I'm an
expert, and apply your own good sense.

**Firstly**: you don't have to get _anything_. I'm going to bring a good amount
of 8m lengths of 6mm purple POSH rope that's I'll be giving out. For the event's
theme, you'll need one length - two at most. So you'll be _fine_ even if you
come with nothing.

On the other hand, rope can be quite personal, and significantly affect what you
can do, and how it feels. So, without further ado, let's get to the advice.

## Maximum Snobbery AKA I Have Money and Don't Want To Think

The stereotypical shibari rope in 2024 is:

- Jute.
- Ogawa or Asanawa.
- 6mm, maybe 8mm.
- Laid ("twisted"), three threads, loosely laid.
- Treated for shibari specifically:
  - Burnt to soften and smoothen.
  - Oiled, likely with JBO.
- Overhand knot ends.
- Natural colour.

So, for example:

- [Anatomie Ogawa Jute]
- [Niet-Lief Asanawa Jute]

OK, now that this is out of the way, let's go to the second level.

## There is Rope Everywhere, For Those With Eyes (metaphorical) To See (metaphorically)

OK, so, not only are your shoelaces rope, but, like, it doesn't even have to be
rope, per se. People do successfully and impressively tie with things like
[aerial silks].

That said, what you use informs what is a good idea to attempt, and how will the
result feel. There's a few things that, at least for this workshop, should be
true about your rope:

- Not impregnated with something that will harm people involved.

  This includes:
  - Toxic materials (what's that ship or construction rope covered with? Do
    know).
  - Allergies (JBO? That nice sandalwood scent thing?).
- Static rope - i.e. doesn't stretch much (unlike climbing rope, for example).
- 6-8mm thickness: not so thin it will cut into your skin, but easy to handle.
- 8-10m length: long enough to be useful, not so long that it will be a hassle.

  Unless you have a specific purpose in mind, it's usually better to join rope
  than go above 10m.
- Nice to touch, to both you and the bottom.

  There are ropes that are _deliberately_ not that, but you don't want the rope
  distracting from the tie, for example.

OK, so that's the basics: safe and nice.

### Short List of Common Choices

- Again, jute, as above, just maybe chill about the "wa" at the end, pick your
  colour, whatever you like.

  It tends to have a very nice, creaky sound, and "polish" with use, making it
  softer and smoother.
- Hemp, popular with many primals.

  Often more rough in contact, and sometimes very minimally treated - made soft
  enough to handle, but retaining a natural "grassy" or "goaty" smell. Some
  people hate that ("ew, why does this smell like a barn"), some people love
  that ("yay, it smells like a barn!").
- Hempex, a popular synthetic fiber.

  Deals with moisture and cleaning better, can be cheaper. Presumably similar
  to hemp.
- POSH, another synthetic. Claims to be similar to jute, which is an obvious
  lie. Strong, reliable, available in any colour you want, including
  fosforescent for that "put on a black latex catsuit and rope it with yellow
  glowing rope on it" plan of yours.
- Cotton "sex shop" rope - usually braided, not laid, and limited in purpose,
  but incredibly soft and deals with moisture (even getting soaked) very well.

  Some people will scare you off from this one, but if you look at old shibari
  movies, there's cotton clothesline everywhere. You can't suspend on it, it
  stretches a bit too much, and have a cutting tool nearby because it compresses
  more than laid rope (thus   you're more likely to not be able to undo your own
  knots), but it has its own benefits.

## Longer Picks For Rope Type

I.e. I'm gonna go to the hardware store and buy something I like.

### Construction

You have two general categories.

#### Laid Rope

So, the classic twisted appearance. Tends to be very solid, not compress much -
that's nice because it makes knots less likely to compress so much you won't be
able to undo them.

The downsides are:

- When soaked, laid rope tends to absorb a lot of moisture and "swell" - so all
  those benefits mentioned above instantly go away, and you end up with
  something impossible to undo without a marlin spike.
- As a beginner, you're going to be quite likely to stick your finger _inside
  the rope_. This tends to damage it, very quickly making your rope unpleasant
  to handle, and unsafe under loads.

#### Braided Rope

If you saw climbing rope, you saw it. Paracord and likely your own shoelaces
are also braided.

Braided rope is often stretchier, and more susceptible to compression. If it has
an inner core it's more likely to retain a "round" shape, but also to surprise
you when tightened enough.

On the plus side, braided rope tend to behave better when wet, doesn't "untwist"
the way twisted rope likes to, and sticking a finger in the middle of it is
rather challenging.

### Material

Mostly mentioned above, but:

- Natural fibers are popular favourites for the feeling on the skin, and tend to
  look better (however subjective that is).
- Jute in particular is smoother, which means it's less likely to "lock" due to
  sheer friction (which can be an issue when you're trying to load rope, and use
  it to pull/lift something - or, worse, when you're trying to _release_ or
  _lower_ something).
- Synthetics are generally less likely to trigger allergies (though YMMV).
- Synthetics and cotton generally handle cleaning better.

Besides the ones mentioned in the short list, there's the final category of
natural materials:

#### The Evil Rope Materials

So you decided to be horrible to both your bottom and yourself.

Fantastic, you're my type of person!

There's several types of rope - mostly, banana and coconut husk - used
specifically to cause pain or discomfort. My own experience in this case is
actually a bit odd - they are less painful, and more... _interesting_.

Note that I said "to both your bottom and yourself." You can't tie with a harsh,
stiff and messy rope and not feel that yourself. Many riggers either avoid those
entirely, or never do structured ties with them. Similarly, many won't untie it
\- but rather cut it to release the model.

Personally, I find tying with the type of rope fun, and the fact it hurts both
side makes for an interesting dynamic. At the same time I had it cut my fingers
to the blood. So, you have been warned.

Finally, this type of rope isn't very strong. It's entirely unsuitable for
suspensions.
