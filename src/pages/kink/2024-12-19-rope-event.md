# Transfem Rope Salon

The general idea is:

- 19th of December in Nieuwe Vide. The event will be between 13:00 and 17:00.
- For transfems and their trans partners.
- I will show the basic square knot if there's a need for that, but assume this
  is a "peer" event - i.e. just because I'm an organizer, doesn't mean I know
  more than you.
- Just a bit pretentious.
  Dimmed lights, set a theme, have tea & coffee. That sort of stuff. I'm not
  going to enforce jute or anything.

## Audience: Transfems and Their Queer Playmates

Queer refers to meaningfully queer, though I'm not going to play queer cop -
just like, someone who is _not_ cishet, who is comfortable calling themselves
queer, and that's about it. This is mostly based on previous polls around here,
figuring out what's going to be most comfortable for our members.

Any constellations, including solos, are welcome - but I can't guarantee you'll
find anyone to tie with unless you bring someone with you.

On the other hand, I, [Anastazja](https://fetlife.com/users/15937458),
frequently self-tie, and very much encourage the practice of self-tying.

The audience is intended to be small - I'd be happy with up to 10 people.

## Cost

No intent for making this cost anything. Feel free to bring snacks (preferably
vegan/vegetarian, so you can share freely, but I'm not gonna play food cop,
I myself ain't either).

## Place, Date & Time

It's on 19th of December, in Nieuwe Vide, the same room as we always meet in,
just with some adjustments for privacy. We will have access to the adjacent room
for all your changing needs.

As for time, it will _most likely_ be a Saturday afternoon, likely either in
late October or early November. If this works out, I'd like to eventually get
into a rhythm where this is a regular/semi-regular occurrence.

The event will be fairly long - 3-4 hours - and I'm going to ask everyone to
arrive on time. On the other hand, after the first 2 hours it shouldn't be too
bad for you to leave. Basically "a lazy afternoon with rope."

## Theme: Basics, Ipponawa, and Watching Your Partner

So, basically, Basics, Basics & Basics.
  
I think this combination makes for a fairly good first event, and a pretty good
experience overall. So, the event would include:

- Shared tea/coffee/snack time, including a round of introductions etc.
- Simple workshop on the square knot, single column tie, and basic frictions.
  - Square knot is probably the most common _knot_ to start a tie. It holds the
    "single column" tie together.
  - A single column tie is just any "tie" that goes around a single "column" -
    arm, leg, chest, table leg - but also two arms closely folded together.
  - Frictions are what you do when ropes cross together, and you want them to
    stay more-or-less fixed in the point they cross each other.
- Introduction to ipponawa.
  Ipponawa is tying with a _single_ length of rope. No:
  - Attaching extra ropes to the end of the one you started with.
  - Adding new ropes after you "tied off" the one you started with.

  You focus on keeping the tension on the rope, and the interactions with your
  partner (possibly, yourself).
- Time dedicated specifically to the "themed" tying.
  So while I won't super strictly police everyone, you'll be encouraged to focus
  on the theme.
- Social, experimentation and free tying time.

## Vibes

I want to go for a more deliberate, focused and "intimate" vibe. Just a dash of
pretentious, for "spice". Thus plans for setting a theme, as well as a bit of
"ritual" - such as providing tea and basic structure, as well as expecting
people to show up at the start of the event (so that everyone participating
takes part in the "ritual" part). This is inspired by some events I have seen
other people organize, and which have been kind-of missing in our scene.

But, ultimately we're all a mess, I'm a proud trash girl, I just like fancy
treats. So sure, I'll bring a nice tea, I'll try to make some nice coffee, I'll
do my best to find some fancy cookies - but if you want to tie with paracord
while dressed in garbage bags (I've seen someone do that!), go ahead! And while
there is going to be a theme and ritual, I don't want that to take up the
_entire_ event. Ideally, the vibes set up during the structured part will
inspire people for the unstructured part.

Cheers,
Anastazja
