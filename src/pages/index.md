## Work Stuff

I'm a software developer. Check out my [Current CV](./resume.pdf).

## Who the fuck am I?

Sandra Camilla Modzelewska, in some contexts Anastazja. I'm going by
[xie/xer](https://en.pronouns.page/@ModZero) pronouns. I'm Polish and I live
in Netherlands.

For work, I write programs - usually in Python or Typescript, but in C#, Rust,
Go or Java when opportunity strikes.

For fun, I code even more, hike, cycle, do [kinky stuff](./kink/) and,
recently, practice boxing (haven't been in the ring _yet_, but I hope to
change that).
