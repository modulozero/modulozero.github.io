## Work Stuff

I'm a software developer. Check out my [Current CV](./resume.pdf).

I specialize in back-end development, especially in Python and Typescript - but
I've also worked with Java, Go, Perl, and even PHP and C, if we're looking into my
old history.

I've dabbled in C# and Rust, and I'd love to use either in the future. My distant
past included work as a system administrator, and more recent a deployment of
Kubernetes on Google Cloud. For the ops side of things, I prefer most dedicated,
rented servers rather than Cloud services - but not to the extent I'd _never_
suggest using cloud tools. I've had contact with Amazon Cloud Services and
Microsoft Azure, but GCS is the only one I've had a significant active role in.

I'm at my best allowed to work very odd hours, remotely or at an office that's
close to me. I'm not incompatible with office work - in fact I enjoy some 
segregation of spaces - but I find many offices to be sensorily overwhelming and
lacking in privacy.

I'm apt at asynchronous work - but I enjoy teamwork, as well as regular active
collaboration - such as pair programming, coaching sessions, or even social calls.
Poorly conducted meetings that drag on are my anathema, but a meeting with a clear
purpose and a _human_ taking minutes can be good, occasionally even enjoyable. I'm
less "this meeting could have been an email," and more "this meeting should have
started with an email" - and sometimes once you write a good enough email, you no
longer want the meeting.

I like to develop a "greenfield"-ish project, especially developing frameworks for
other people to fill in. It brings me joy to see other developers build on top of
my work, and I actively _enjoy_ gathering feedback on whether my "elegant" solutions
are truly elegant, or just eldritch abominations, fascinating but terrifying.

On the other hand, I do like an occasional deep dive into a misbehaving legacy
system. While it can be exhausting, few things let you develop as many interesting
stories.

I've worked in both large teams, and as the sole technical employee. I've had some
experience as a freelancing contractor, and I'm interested in going back in that
direction. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure enjoy an opportunity to do more team
leadership and mentoring juniors. Perhaps the biggest of my current interests is less
specific technical skills, and more "teaching people."

## Who the fuck am I?

Sandra Camilla Modzelewska, in some contexts Anastazja. I'm going by
[xie/xer](https://en.pronouns.page/@ModZero) pronouns. I'm Polish and I live
in Netherlands.

For work, I write programs - usually in Python or Typescript, but in C#, Rust,
Go or Java when opportunity strikes.

For fun, I code even more, play video games, hike, cycle, swim,
do [kinky stuff](./kink/) and practice boxing.
